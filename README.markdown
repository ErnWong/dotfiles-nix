# My Personal Workspace Setup

![fancy image with awesome drop shadow](cover.png)

"Tested" on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows. By extension, it *should* work on linux and mac, methinks.

## Usage

Simply run `./install.sh` on your trusty shell, and it would theoretically install some packages.

**Note:** it is a good idea to read through the source of *any* script you find on the internet before running them.

If a package had already been installed, re-running `.install.sh` should be fine.

## Purpose of This Repo

1. So I can backup my setup script
2. So you creeps out there can have a look at it, get inspiration from it, hopefully learn, grow, fork, hack, regret, make fun of it...
